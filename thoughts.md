// should transactions have an add method => is it a monoid?

// nice liberty when introducing transactions
// dateProvider injected as a stub, using mocking tools

// What about the transaction store, should it be handled in the
// imperative shell perhaps?

// can't really test the statement as it could very well be a pure data object

// I really have to hardcode the reference to Money new and add everywhere


// I almost didn't see the extraneous debits and credits in the statement
